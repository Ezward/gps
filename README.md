## Welcome to GitHub Pages for https://ezward.github.io/gps

This is content regarding GPS, GNSS, RTK GPS, RTKLIB, and setting all this up on a Donkeycar with a RaspberryPi or a Jetson Nano so the Donkeycar can get high resolution gps coordinates while it drives on an outdoor track.

See www.donkeycar.com for information on Donkeycar.
